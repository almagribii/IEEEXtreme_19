[IEEEXtreme](https://ieeextreme.org/) is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. In this __repository__, you will find the __Problemset__ and some __Solutions__ of IEEEXtreme 15.0 .


## Practice Session :

In the Problemset folder, you will find the pdf version of the problems. To practice and get your score, try to solve the problems by yourself and submit your solutions, each title in the list below will take you to The CSAcademy practice session of the problem.
